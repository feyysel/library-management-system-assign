## Git Workflow

-Initialized the repository using git init

-Staged project files using git add

-Created atomic commits with descriptive messages using git commit

-Created a feature branch LoanManagement using git checkout -b LoanManagement

-Implemented loan-related features in the isolated feature branch

-Pushed the feature branch to the remote repository using git push origin LoanManagement

-Opened a Pull Request for code review

-Merged approved changes into the main branch

## Branching & Merging Flow

-The main branch always contains stable and production-ready code

-Feature development is done in dedicated branches (e.g., LoanManagement)

-Pull Requests are used to:

    Review code changes

    Ensure code quality

prevent direct commits to main

-After successful review, feature branches are merged into main
